# Hackathon1BreweryAPI
Description :
Implement the Open Brewery API using async/await with fetch.

Constraints:

All your HTML elements should be created with DOM.
Use the async/await.
Use try-catch to handle errors.
Use fetch() to get the data from Open Brewery API
All JavaScript codes should be in a script file named script.js which has to be imported in your HTML page.
Implement a search filter based on the text entered in the input field.
How do I process the API data?

Display the breweries name and type.
Display the breweryâ€™s address.
Also display the website url.
Display the phone no of the brewery.
Any basic hints to solve:

**There are 2 script files but original is script.js.
In script1.js , i took different functions(it is optional) which prints single output in console. I just collated that functions in script.js so we get all details of a city.**
